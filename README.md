# Munchies

An app to simplify the food ordering process in small and medium size
companies

Software Requirement Specification

## Application Summary

Food is an important and integral part of everyday life at any company. A lot of time and effort is
spent when:
1. employees decide on the restaurant
2. make the order to the chosen restaurant

This application tries to alleviate these problems by offering employees a centralized repository
of restaurants along with contact information and menus. Furthermore it allows employees to
create group orders that can easily be relaid to restaurants. It does this by having two distinct
parts:

**1. Administration portal**

Used for: adding restaurants, global configuration

**2. Employee portal**

Used for: viewing restaurant information, creating a group order, submitting individual
orders to the group order

## Roles
There is a total of 2 roles:

**1. Administrator**

Authenticated by an email and password. Only this role can access the administration
portal.

**2. Employee (anonymous)**

This role does not have any authentication requirements. All unauthenticated requests
are considered to belong to this role. This role can access the employee portal.
